# ibm-calculator
This Python program calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a userâ€™s weight and height. It continuously allows multiple users to check their BMI in one session. The program classifies BMI into categories: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obesity, and displays the result. It runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
